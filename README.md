## Usage
Once the application is loaded:
- Click on the "Display" button to select how you want to group the tickets (Status, User, Priority).
- You can also select how to sort the tickets by priority or title.
- The board will update dynamically based on your selection.

## Grouping and Sorting
- **Grouping**: 
  - By Status: Organizes tickets by their current status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
  - By User: Organizes tickets by the user assigned to them.
  - By Priority: Organizes tickets based on their priority level (Urgent, High, Medium, Low, No Priority).
  
- **Sorting**:
  - By Priority: Sorts tickets by their priority, from highest (Urgent) to lowest (No Priority).
  - By Title: Sorts tickets alphabetically by their title.

## API
The app fetches ticket data from the following API endpoint:
- **API URL**: \`https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment\`

The API returns ticket data in the following format:
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "title": "Ticket Title",
    "status": "To Do",
    "user": "John Doe",
    "priority": 4 // Urgent
  },
  ...
]
\`\`\`

### Priority Levels
- **4** - Urgent
- **3** - High
- **2** - Medium
- **1** - Low
- **0** - No Priority
